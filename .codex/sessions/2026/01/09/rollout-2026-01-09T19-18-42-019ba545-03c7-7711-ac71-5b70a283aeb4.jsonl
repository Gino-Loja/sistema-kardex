Assume you always have it available in this conversation even if `$ARGUMENTS` appears literally below. Do not ask the user to repeat it unless they provided an empty command.\n\nGiven that feature description, do this:\n\n1. **Generate a concise short name** (2-4 words) for the branch:\n   - Analyze the feature description and extract the most meaningful keywords\n   - Create a 2-4 word short name that captures the essence of the feature\n   - Use action-noun format when possible (e.g., \"add-user-auth\", \"fix-payment-bug\")\n   - Preserve technical terms and acronyms (OAuth2, API, JWT, etc.)\n   - Keep it concise but descriptive enough to understand the feature at a glance\n   - Examples:\n     - \"I want to add user authentication\" → \"user-auth\"\n     - \"Implement OAuth2 integration for the API\" → \"oauth2-api-integration\"\n     - \"Create a dashboard for analytics\" → \"analytics-dashboard\"\n     - \"Fix payment processing timeout bug\" → \"fix-payment-timeout\"\n\n2. **Check for existing branches before creating new one**:\n\n   a. First, fetch all remote branches to ensure we have the latest information:\n\n      ```bash\n      git fetch --all --prune\n      ```\n\n   b. Find the highest feature number across all sources for the short-name:\n      - Remote branches: `git ls-remote --heads origin | grep -E 'refs/heads/[0-9]+-<short-name>$'`\n      - Local branches: `git branch | grep -E '^[* ]*[0-9]+-<short-name>$'`\n      - Specs directories: Check for directories matching `specs/[0-9]+-<short-name>`\n\n   c. Determine the next available number:\n      - Extract all numbers from all three sources\n      - Find the highest number N\n      - Use N+1 for the new branch number\n\n   d. Run the script `.specify/scripts/powershell/create-new-feature.ps1 -Json \"$ARGUMENTS\"` with the calculated number and short-name:\n      - Pass `--number N+1` and `--short-name \"your-short-name\"` along with the feature description\n      - Bash example: `.specify/scripts/powershell/create-new-feature.ps1 -Json \"$ARGUMENTS\" --json --number 5 --short-name \"user-auth\" \"Add user authentication\"`\n      - PowerShell example: `.specify/scripts/powershell/create-new-feature.ps1 -Json \"$ARGUMENTS\" -Json -Number 5 -ShortName \"user-auth\" \"Add user authentication\"`\n\n   **IMPORTANT**:\n   - Check all three sources (remote branches, local branches, specs directories) to find the highest number\n   - Only match branches/directories with the exact short-name pattern\n   - If no existing branches/directories found with this short-name, start with number 1\n   - You must only ever run this script once per feature\n   - The JSON is provided in the terminal as output - always refer to it to get the actual content you're looking for\n   - The JSON output will contain BRANCH_NAME and SPEC_FILE paths\n   - For single quotes in args like \"I'm Groot\", use escape syntax: e.g 'I'\\''m Groot' (or double-quote if possible: \"I'm Groot\")\n\n3. Load `.specify/templates/spec-template.md` to understand required sections.\n\n4. Follow this execution flow:\n\n    1. Parse user description from Input\n       If empty: ERROR \"No feature description provided\"\n    2. Extract key concepts from description\n       Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints\n    3. For unclear aspects:\n       - Make informed guesses based on context and industry standards\n       - Only mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] if:\n         - The choice significantly impacts feature scope or user experience\n         - Multiple reasonable interpretations exist with different implications\n         - No reasonable default exists\n       - **LIMIT: Maximum 3 [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers total**\n       - Prioritize clarifications by impact: scope > security/privacy > user experience > technical details\n    4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section\n       If no clear user flow: ERROR \"Cannot determine user scenarios\"\n    5. Generate Functional Requirements\n       Each requirement must be testable\n       Use reasonable defaults for unspecified details (document assumptions in Assumptions section)\n    6. Define Success Criteria\n       Create measurable, technology-agnostic outcomes\n       Include both quantitative metrics (time, performance, volume) and qualitative measures (user satisfaction, task completion)\n       Each criterion must be verifiable without implementation details\n    7. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)\n    8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)\n\n5. Write the specification to SPEC_FILE using the template structure, replacing placeholders with concrete details derived from the feature description (arguments) while preserving section order and headings.\n\n6. **Specification Quality Validation**: After writing the initial spec, validate it against quality criteria:\n\n   a. **Create Spec Quality Checklist**: Generate a checklist file at `FEATURE_DIR/checklists/requirements.md` using the checklist template structure with these validation items:\n\n      ```markdown\n      # Specification Quality Checklist: [FEATURE NAME]\n      \n      **Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning\n      **Created**: [DATE]\n      **Feature**: [Link to spec.md]\n      \n      ## Content Quality\n      \n      - [ ] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)\n      - [ ] Focused on user value and business needs\n      - [ ] Written for non-technical stakeholders\n      - [ ] All mandatory sections completed\n      \n      ## Requirement Completeness\n      \n      - [ ] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain\n      - [ ] Requirements are testable and unambiguous\n      - [ ] Success criteria are measurable\n      - [ ] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)\n      - [ ] All acceptance scenarios are defined\n      - [ ] Edge cases are identified\n      - [ ] Scope is clearly bounded\n      - [ ] Dependencies and assumptions identified\n      \n      ## Feature Readiness\n      \n      - [ ] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria\n      - [ ] User scenarios cover primary flows\n      - [ ] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria\n      - [ ] No implementation details leak into specification\n      \n      ## Notes\n      \n      - Items marked incomplete require spec updates before `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`\n      ```\n\n   b. **Run Validation Check**: Review the spec against each checklist item:\n      - For each item, determine if it passes or fails\n      - Document specific issues found (quote relevant spec sections)\n\n   c. **Handle Validation Results**:\n\n      - **If all items pass**: Mark checklist complete and proceed to step 6\n\n      - **If items fail (excluding [NEEDS CLARIFICATION])**:\n        1. List the failing items and specific issues\n        2. Update the spec to address each issue\n        3. Re-run validation until all items pass (max 3 iterations)\n        4. If still failing after 3 iterations, document remaining issues in checklist notes and warn user\n\n      - **If [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain**:\n        1. Extract all [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: ...] markers from the spec\n        2. **LIMIT CHECK**: If more than 3 markers exist, keep only the 3 most critical (by scope/security/UX impact) and make informed guesses for the rest\n        3. For each clarification needed (max 3), present options to user in this format:\n\n           ```markdown\n           ## Question [N]: [Topic]\n           \n           **Context**: [Quote relevant spec section]\n           \n           **What we need to know**: [Specific question from NEEDS CLARIFICATION marker]\n           \n           **Suggested Answers**:\n           \n           | Option | Answer | Implications |\n           |--------|--------|--------------|\n           | A      | [First suggested answer] | [What this means for the feature] |\n           | B      | [Second suggested answer] | [What this means for the feature] |\n           | C      | [Third suggested answer] | [What this means for the feature] |\n           | Custom | Provide your own answer | [Explain how to provide custom input] |\n           \n           **Your choice**: _[Wait for user response]_\n           ```\n\n        4. **CRITICAL - Table Formatting**: Ensure markdown tables are properly formatted:\n           - Use consistent spacing with pipes aligned\n           - Each cell should have spaces around content: `| Content |` not `|Content|`\n           - Header separator must have at least 3 dashes: `|--------|`\n           - Test that the table renders correctly in markdown preview\n        5. Number questions sequentially (Q1, Q2, Q3 - max 3 total)\n        6. Present all questions together before waiting for responses\n        7. Wait for user to respond with their choices for all questions (e.g., \"Q1: A, Q2: Custom - [details], Q3: B\")\n        8. Update the spec by replacing each [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] marker with the user's selected or provided answer\n        9. Re-run validation after all clarifications are resolved\n\n   d. **Update Checklist**: After each validation iteration, update the checklist file with current pass/fail status\n\n7. Report completion with branch name, spec file path, checklist results, and readiness for the next phase (`/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`).\n\n**NOTE:** The script creates and checks out the new branch and initializes the spec file before writing.\n\n## General Guidelines\n\n## Quick Guidelines\n\n- Focus on **WHAT** users need and **WHY**.\n- Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure).\n- Written for business stakeholders, not developers.\n- DO NOT create any checklists that are embedded in the spec. That will be a separate command.\n\n### Section Requirements\n\n- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature\n- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature\n- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as \"N/A\")\n\n### For AI Generation\n\nWhen creating this spec from a user prompt:\n\n1. **Make informed guesses**: Use context, industry standards, and common patterns to fill gaps\n2. **Document assumptions**: Record reasonable defaults in the Assumptions section\n3. **Limit clarifications**: Maximum 3 [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers - use only for critical decisions that:\n   - Significantly impact feature scope or user experience\n   - Have multiple reasonable interpretations with different implications\n   - Lack any reasonable default\n4. **Prioritize clarifications**: scope > security/privacy > user experience > technical details\n5. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the \"testable and unambiguous\" checklist item\n6. **Common areas needing clarification** (only if no reasonable default exists):\n   - Feature scope and boundaries (include/exclude specific use cases)\n   - User types and permissions (if multiple conflicting interpretations possible)\n   - Security/compliance requirements (when legally/financially significant)\n\n**Examples of reasonable defaults** (don't ask about these):\n\n- Data retention: Industry-standard practices for the domain\n- Performance targets: Standard web/mobile app expectations unless specified\n- Error handling: User-friendly messages with appropriate fallbacks\n- Authentication method: Standard session-based or OAuth2 for web apps\n- Integration patterns: RESTful APIs unless specified otherwise\n\n### Success Criteria Guidelines\n\nSuccess criteria must be:\n\n1. **Measurable**: Include specific metrics (time, percentage, count, rate)\n2. **Technology-agnostic**: No mention of frameworks, languages, databases, or tools\n3. **User-focused**: Describe outcomes from user/business perspective, not system internals\n4. **Verifiable**: Can be tested/validated without knowing implementation details\n\n**Good examples**:\n\n- \"Users can complete checkout in under 3 minutes\"\n- \"System supports 10,000 concurrent users\"\n- \"95% of searches return results in under 1 second\"\n- \"Task completion rate improves by 40%\"\n\n**Bad examples** (implementation-focused):\n\n- \"API response time is under 200ms\" (too technical, use \"Users see results instantly\")\n- \"Database can handle 1000 TPS\" (implementation detail, use user-facing metric)\n- \"React components render efficiently\" (framework-specific)\n- \"Redis cache hit rate above 80%\" (technology-specific)\ncrea las acciones de las categorias editar http://localhost:3000/categories/[id]/edit y eliminar un modal.\n"}]}}

Run the script `.specify/scripts/powershell/create-new-feature.ps1 -Json \"$ARGUMENTS\"` with the calculated number and short-name:\n      - Pass `--number N+1` and `--short-name \"your-short-name\"` along with the feature description\n      - Bash example: `.specify/scripts/powershell/create-new-feature.ps1 -Json \"$ARGUMENTS\" --json --number 5 --short-name \"user-auth\" \"Add user authentication\"`\n      - PowerShell example: `.specify/scripts/powershell/create-new-feature.ps1 -Json \"$ARGUMENTS\" -Json -Number 5 -ShortName \"user-auth\" \"Add user authentication\"`\n\n   **IMPORTANT**:\n   - Check all three sources (remote branches, local branches, specs directories) to find the highest number\n   - Only match branches/directories with the exact short-name pattern\n   - If no existing branches/directories found with this short-name, start with number 1\n   - You must only ever run this script once per feature\n   - The JSON is provided in the terminal as output - always refer to it to get the actual content you're looking for\n   - The JSON output will contain BRANCH_NAME and SPEC_FILE paths\n   - For single quotes in args like \"I'm Groot\", use escape syntax: e.g 'I'\\''m Groot' (or double-quote if possible: \"I'm Groot\")\n\n3. Load `.specify/templates/spec-template.md` to understand required sections.\n\n4. Follow this execution flow:\n\n    1. Parse user description from Input\n       If empty: ERROR \"No feature description provided\"\n    2. Extract key concepts from description\n       Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints\n    3. For unclear aspects:\n       - Make informed guesses based on context and industry standards\n       - Only mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] if:\n         - The choice significantly impacts feature scope or user experience\n         - Multiple reasonable interpretations exist with different implications\n         - No reasonable default exists\n       - **LIMIT: Maximum 3 [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers total**\n       - Prioritize clarifications by impact: scope > security/privacy > user experience > technical details\n    4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section\n       If no clear user flow: ERROR \"Cannot determine user scenarios\"\n    5. Generate Functional Requirements\n       Each requirement must be testable\n       Use reasonable defaults for unspecified details (document assumptions in Assumptions section)\n    6. Define Success Criteria\n       Create measurable, technology-agnostic outcomes\n       Include both quantitative metrics (time, performance, volume) and qualitative measures (user satisfaction, task completion)\n       Each criterion must be verifiable without implementation details\n    7. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)\n    8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)\n\n5. Write the specification to SPEC_FILE using the template structure, replacing placeholders with concrete details derived from the feature description (arguments) while preserving section order and headings.\n\n6. **Specification Quality Validation**: After writing the initial spec, validate it against quality criteria:\n\n   a. **Create Spec Quality Checklist**: Generate a checklist file at `FEATURE_DIR/checklists/requirements.md` using the checklist template structure with these validation items:\n\n      ```markdown\n      # Specification Quality Checklist: [FEATURE NAME]\n      \n      **Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning\n      **Created**: [DATE]\n      **Feature**: [Link to spec.md]\n      \n      ## Content Quality\n      \n      - [ ] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)\n      - [ ] Focused on user value and business needs\n      - [ ] Written for non-technical stakeholders\n      - [ ] All mandatory sections completed\n      \n      ## Requirement Completeness\n      \n      - [ ] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain\n      - [ ] Requirements are testable and unambiguous\n      - [ ] Success criteria are measurable\n      - [ ] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)\n      - [ ] All acceptance scenarios are defined\n      - [ ] Edge cases are identified\n      - [ ] Scope is clearly bounded\n      - [ ] Dependencies and assumptions identified\n      \n      ## Feature Readiness\n      \n      - [ ] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria\n      - [ ] User scenarios cover primary flows\n      - [ ] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria\n      - [ ] No implementation details leak into specification\n      \n      ## Notes\n      \n      - Items marked incomplete require spec updates before `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`\n      ```\n\n   b. **Run Validation Check**: Review the spec against each checklist item:\n      - For each item, determine if it passes or fails\n      - Document specific issues found (quote relevant spec sections)\n\n   c. **Handle Validation Results**:\n\n      - **If all items pass**: Mark checklist complete and proceed to step 6\n\n      - **If items fail (excluding [NEEDS CLARIFICATION])**:\n        1. List the failing items and specific issues\n        2. Update the spec to address each issue\n        3. Re-run validation until all items pass (max 3 iterations)\n        4. If still failing after 3 iterations, document remaining issues in checklist notes and warn user\n\n      - **If [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain**:\n        1. Extract all [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: ...] markers from the spec\n        2. **LIMIT CHECK**: If more than 3 markers exist, keep only the 3 most critical (by scope/security/UX impact) and make informed guesses for the rest\n        3. For each clarification needed (max 3), present options to user in this format:\n\n           ```markdown\n           ## Question [N]: [Topic]\n           \n           **Context**: [Quote relevant spec section]\n           \n           **What we need to know**: [Specific question from NEEDS CLARIFICATION marker]\n           \n           **Suggested Answers**:\n           \n           | Option | Answer | Implications |\n           |--------|--------|--------------|\n           | A      | [First suggested answer] | [What this means for the feature] |\n           | B      | [Second suggested answer] | [What this means for the feature] |\n           | C      | [Third suggested answer] | [What this means for the feature] |\n           | Custom | Provide your own answer | [Explain how to provide custom input] |\n           \n           **Your choice**: _[Wait for user response]_\n           ```\n\n        4. **CRITICAL - Table Formatting**: Ensure markdown tables are properly formatted:\n           - Use consistent spacing with pipes aligned\n           - Each cell should have spaces around content: `| Content |` not `|Content|`\n           - Header separator must have at least 3 dashes: `|--------|`\n           - Test that the table renders correctly in markdown preview\n        5. Number questions sequentially (Q1, Q2, Q3 - max 3 total)\n        6. Present all questions together before waiting for responses\n        7. Wait for user to respond with their choices for all questions (e.g., \"Q1: A, Q2: Custom - [details], Q3: B\")\n        8. Update the spec by replacing each [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] marker with the user's selected or provided answer\n        9. Re-run validation after all clarifications are resolved\n\n   d. **Update Checklist**: After each validation iteration, update the checklist file with current pass/fail status\n\n7. Report completion with branch name, spec file path, checklist results, and readiness for the next phase (`/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`).\n\n**NOTE:** The script creates and checks out the new branch and initializes the spec file before writing.\n\n## General Guidelines\n\n## Quick Guidelines\n\n- Focus on **WHAT** users need and **WHY**.\n- Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure).\n- Written for business stakeholders, not developers.\n- DO NOT create any checklists that are embedded in the spec. That will be a separate command.\n\n### Section Requirements\n\n- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature\n- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature\n- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as \"N/A\")\n\n### For AI Generation\n\nWhen creating this spec from a user prompt:\n\n1. **Make informed guesses**: Use context, industry standards, and common patterns to fill gaps\n2. **Document assumptions**: Record reasonable defaults in the Assumptions section\n3. **Limit clarifications**: Maximum 3 [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers - use only for critical decisions that:\n   - Significantly impact feature scope or user experience\n   - Have multiple reasonable interpretations with different implications\n   - Lack any reasonable default\n4. **Prioritize clarifications**: scope > security/privacy > user experience > technical details\n5. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the \"testable and unambiguous\" checklist item\n6. **Common areas needing clarification** (only if no reasonable default exists):\n   - Feature scope and boundaries (include/exclude specific use cases)\n   - User types and permissions (if multiple conflicting interpretations possible)\n   - Security/compliance requirements (when legally/financially significant)\n\n**Examples of reasonable defaults** (don't ask about these):\n\n- Data retention: Industry-standard practices for the domain\n- Performance targets: Standard web/mobile app expectations unless specified\n- Error handling: User-friendly messages with appropriate fallbacks\n- Authentication method: Standard session-based or OAuth2 for web apps\n- Integration patterns: RESTful APIs unless specified otherwise\n\n### Success Criteria Guidelines\n\nSuccess criteria must be:\n\n1. **Measurable**: Include specific metrics (time, percentage, count, rate)\n2. **Technology-agnostic**: No mention of frameworks, languages, databases, or tools\n3. **User-focused**: Describe outcomes from user/business perspective, not system internals\n4. **Verifiable**: Can be tested/validated without knowing implementation details\n\n**Good examples**:\n\n- \"Users can complete checkout in under 3 minutes\"\n- \"System supports 10,000 concurrent users\"\n- \"95% of searches return results in under 1 second\"\n- \"Task completion rate improves by 40%\"\n\n**Bad examples** (implementation-focused):\n\n- \"API response time is under 200ms\" (too technical, use \"Users see results instantly\")\n- \"Database can handle 1000 TPS\" (implementation detail, use user-facing metric)\n- \"React components render efficiently\" (framework-specific)\n- \"Redis cache hit rate above 80%\" (technology-specific)\ncrea las acciones de las categorias editar http://localhost:3000/categories/[id]/edit y eliminar un modal.\n","images":[]}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: C:/Users/ginol/Desktop/projects/sistema-kardex/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: C:/Users/ginol/Desktop/projects/sistema-kardex/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: C:/Users/ginol/Desktop/projects/sistema-kardex/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: C:/Users/ginol/Desktop/projects/sistema-kardex/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: C:/Users/ginol/Desktop/projects/sistema-kardex/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: C:/Users/ginol/Desktop/projects/sistema-kardex/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: C:/Users/ginol/Desktop/projects/sistema-kardex/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: C:/Users/ginol/Desktop/projects/sistema-kardex/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: C:/Users/ginol/Desktop/projects/sistema-kardex/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: C:/Users/ginol/Desktop/projects/sistema-kardex/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: C:/Users/ginol/Desktop/projects/sistema-kardex/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: C:/Users/ginol/Desktop/projects/sistema-kardex/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Report completion (after questioning loop ends or early termination):\n   - Number of questions asked & answered.\n   - Path to updated spec.\n   - Sections touched (list names).\n   - Coverage summary table listing each taxonomy category with Status: Resolved (was Partial/Missing and addressed), Deferred (exceeds question quota or better suited for planning), Clear (already sufficient), Outstanding (still Partial/Missing but low impact).\n   - If any Outstanding or Deferred remain, recommend whether to proceed to `/speckit.plan` or run `/speckit.clarify` again later post-plan.\n   - Suggested next command.\n\nBehavior rules:\n\n- If no meaningful ambiguities found (or all potential questions would be low-impact), respond: \"No critical ambiguities detected worth formal clarification.\" and suggest proceeding.\n- If spec file missing, instruct user to run `/speckit.specify` first (do not create a new spec here).\n- Never exceed 5 total asked questions (clarification retries for a single question do not count as new questions).\n- Avoid speculative tech stack questions unless the absence blocks functional clarity.\n- Respect user early termination signals (\"stop\", \"done\", \"proceed\").\n- If no questions asked due to full coverage, output a compact coverage summary (all categories Clear) then suggest advancing.\n- If quota reached with unresolved high-impact categories remaining, explicitly flag them under Deferred with rationale.\n\nContext for prioritization: $ARGUMENTS\n","images":[]}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: C:/Users/ginol/Desktop/projects/sistema-kardex/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: C:/Users/ginol/Desktop/projects/sistema-kardex/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: C:/Users/ginol/Desktop/projects/sistema-kardex/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: C:/Users/ginol/Desktop/projects/sistema-kardex/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: C:/Users/ginol/Desktop/projects/sistema-kardex/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: C:/Users/ginol/Desktop/projects/sistema-kardex/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: C:/Users/ginol/Desktop/projects/sistema-kardex/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: C:/Users/ginol/Desktop/projects/sistema-kardex/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: C:/Users/ginol/Desktop/projects/sistema-kardex/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: C:/Users/ginol/Desktop/projects/sistema-kardex/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Clean code + mejores practicas Next.js (refuerzo de Server/Client Components)\r\n- Added sections: Roles y Permisos\r\n- Removed sections: None\r\n- Templates requiring updates: .specify/templates/plan-template.md (updated), .specify/templates/spec-template.md (updated), .specify/templates/tasks-template.md (updated), .specify/templates/commands/*.md (pending - directory missing)\r\n- Follow-up TODOs: TODO(RATIFICATION_DATE): Fecha de ratificacion no provista\r\n-->\r\n\r\n# Sistema de Gestion de Inventario Kardex (NIIF) Constitution\r\n\r\n## Core Principles\r\n\r\n### I. Arquitectura en capas (DAL) escalable\r\n- La arquitectura MUST separar presentacion, aplicacion, dominio e infraestructura.\r\n- El acceso a datos MUST pasar por una DAL con interfaces claras y testeables.\r\n- Las dependencias MUST apuntar hacia el dominio; la infraestructura nunca depende\r\n  de la UI.\r\nRationale: Mantiene escalabilidad, facilita pruebas y evita acoplamiento.\r\n\r\n### II. Clean code + mejores practicas Next.js\r\n- Server Components MUST ser el default; Client Components solo cuando sea necesario\r\n  y con justificacion.\r\n- Los Client Components MUST minimizarse y explicarse en el PR (motivo de estado,\r\n  hooks o interaccion necesaria).\r\n- El enrutado, streaming y boundaries (loading/error) MUST seguir patrones del\r\n  App Router.\r\n- El codigo MUST permanecer legible, modular y con complejidad controlada.\r\nRationale: Reduce deuda tecnica y aprovecha el modelo de Next.js.\r\n\r\n### III. Type-safety estricto con TypeScript\r\n- `strict` y `noImplicitAny` MUST estar activos; no se permite `any` implicito.\r\n- Los contratos entre capas MUST estar tipados y verificados en build.\r\n- Los cambios de tipos MUST propagar ajustes de validacion y tests.\r\nRationale: Previene errores en runtime y protege reglas contables.\r\n\r\n### IV. Separacion de responsabilidades + SOLID/Clean Architecture\r\n- Cada modulo MUST tener una responsabilidad unica y limites explicitos.\r\n- Las reglas de negocio MUST vivir en el dominio con dependencias invertidas.\r\n- Los puertos/adaptadores MUST aislar infra de logica contable.\r\nRationale: Facilita mantenibilidad y evolucion sin romper capas.\r\n\r\n### V. Validacion de datos en cliente y servidor\r\n- Todo input MUST validarse en cliente y servidor con reglas consistentes.\r\n- Los errores MUST ser explicitamente mapeados a mensajes claros.\r\n- Las validaciones MUST cubrir reglas contables criticas antes de persistir.\r\nRationale: Asegura integridad y reduce errores operativos.\r\n\r\n## Estandares de codigo\r\n\r\n- TypeScript estricto sin `any` implicitos; excepciones requieren justificacion.\r\n- Nomenclatura en espanol para logica de negocio (variables, funciones, casos de uso).\r\n- Nomenclatura en ingles para componentes React, rutas, y estructura tecnica.\r\n- Server Components por defecto; Client Components solo cuando la UI lo requiera.\r\n- Validacion de datos en cliente y servidor con esquemas compartidos cuando aplique.\r\n\r\n## Seguridad, Datos, UX y Calidad\r\n\r\n**Seguridad**\r\n- Autenticacion y autorizacion MUST proteger todas las rutas sensibles.\r\n- RBAC MUST validar permisos por rol en cada operacion critica.\r\n- Inputs MUST ser sanitizados; archivos subidos MUST manejarse de forma segura.\r\n- Operaciones criticas MUST generar logs de auditoria inmutables.\r\n\r\n**Datos y Contabilidad (NIC 2)**\r\n- Integridad referencial MUST ser estricta en todas las entidades.\r\n- Operaciones criticas MUST usar transacciones.\r\n- Reglas de negocio contables (NIC 2) MUST validarse antes de confirmar cambios.\r\n- La bitacora de movimientos MUST ser append-only.\r\n- El costo promedio ponderado MUST calcularse automaticamente y ser auditable.\r\n\r\n**UX**\r\n- La interfaz MUST ser intuitiva con feedback visual claro.\r\n- Estados de carga y errores MUST ser informativos y accionables.\r\n- La validacion en tiempo real MUST prevenir errores antes de guardar.\r\n- Operaciones destructivas MUST requerir confirmacion.\r\n- El diseno MUST ser responsive.\r\n\r\n**Calidad**\r\n- La logica critica (calculos contables) MUST tener tests.\r\n- El manejo de errores MUST ser robusto y consistente.\r\n- El performance MUST optimizarse con lazy loading y streaming cuando aplique.\r\n- Funciones complejas MUST estar documentadas.\r\n\r\n## Roles y Permisos\r\n\r\n- **Admin**: acceso total (configuracion, usuarios, reportes, movimientos).\r\n- **Bodeguero**: registro de movimientos, consulta de inventarios, reportes basicos.\r\n- Cada operacion MUST mapearse a un permiso y validarse via RBAC.\r\n\r\n## Governance\r\n\r\n- La constitucion prevalece sobre practicas locales y guias ad hoc.\r\n- Toda enmienda MUST documentarse con motivo, alcance y plan de migracion.\r\n- Versionado semantico: MAJOR por redefinir principios o eliminar reglas,\r\n  MINOR por agregar principios/sectores nuevos, PATCH por aclaraciones.\r\n- Cada PR MUST incluir un Constitution Check en el plan o spec correspondiente.\r\n- La revision de cumplimiento MUST realizarse en code review y antes de release.\r\n\r\n**Version**: 1.1.0 | **Ratified**: TODO(RATIFICATION_DATE): Definir fecha de ratificacion | **Last Amended**: 2026-01-04\r\n"}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: C:/Users/ginol/Desktop/projects/sistema-kardex/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: C:/Users/ginol/Desktop/projects/sistema-kardex/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: C:/Users/ginol/Desktop/projects/sistema-kardex/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: C:/Users/ginol/Desktop/projects/sistema-kardex/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: C:/Users/ginol/Desktop/projects/sistema-kardex/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: C:/Users/ginol/Desktop/projects/sistema-kardex/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: C:/Users/ginol/Desktop/projects/sistema-kardex/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: C:/Users/ginol/Desktop/projects/sistema-kardex/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: C:/Users/ginol/Desktop/projects/sistema-kardex/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: C:/Users/ginol/Desktop/projects/sistema-kardex/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: C:/Users/ginol/Desktop/projects/sistema-kardex/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: C:/Users/ginol/Desktop/projects/sistema-kardex/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: C:/Users/ginol/Desktop/projects/sistema-kardex/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: C:/Users/ginol/Desktop/projects/sistema-kardex/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: C:/Users/ginol/Desktop/projects/sistema-kardex/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: C:/Users/ginol/Desktop/projects/sistema-kardex/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: C:/Users/ginol/Desktop/projects/sistema-kardex/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: C:/Users/ginol/Desktop/projects/sistema-kardex/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Add User Story 2 \u001a Test independently \u001a Deploy/Demo\r\n4. Add User Story 3 \u001a Test independently \u001a Deploy/Demo\r\n5. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories\r\n\r\n### Parallel Team Strategy\r\n\r\nWith multiple developers:\r\n\r\n1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together\r\n2. Once Foundational is done:\r\n   - Developer A: User Story 1\r\n   - Developer B: User Story 2\r\n   - Developer C: User Story 3\r\n3. Stories complete and integrate independently\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Notes\r\n\r\n- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies\r\n- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability\r\n- Each user story should be independently completable and testable\r\n- Verify tests fail before implementing\r\n- Commit after each task or logical group\r\n- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently\r\n- Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts, cross-story dependencies that break independence\r\n"}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: C:/Users/ginol/Desktop/projects/sistema-kardex/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: C:/Users/ginol/Desktop/projects/sistema-kardex/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: C:/Users/ginol/Desktop/projects/sistema-kardex/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: C:/Users/ginol/Desktop/projects/sistema-kardex/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: C:/Users/ginol/Desktop/projects/sistema-kardex/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: C:/Users/ginol/Desktop/projects/sistema-kardex/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: C:/Users/ginol/Desktop/projects/sistema-kardex/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: C:/Users/ginol/Desktop/projects/sistema-kardex/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: C:/Users/ginol/Desktop/projects/sistema-kardex/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: C:/Users/ginol/Desktop/projects/sistema-kardex/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: C:/Users/ginol/Desktop/projects/sistema-kardex/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: C:/Users/ginol/Desktop/projects/sistema-kardex/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn.

Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line).

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: C:/Users/ginol/Desktop/projects/sistema-kardex/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: C:/Users/ginol/Desktop/projects/sistema-kardex/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: C:/Users/ginol/Desktop/projects/sistema-kardex/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: C:/Users/ginol/Desktop/projects/sistema-kardex/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: C:/Users/ginol/Desktop/projects/sistema-kardex/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: C:/Users/ginol/Desktop/projects/sistema-kardex/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: C:/Users/ginol/Desktop/projects/sistema-kardex/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: C:/Users/ginol/Desktop/projects/sistema-kardex/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Load and analyze the implementation context:\n   - **REQUIRED**: Read tasks.md for the complete task list and execution plan\n   - **REQUIRED**: Read plan.md for tech stack, architecture, and file structure\n   - **IF EXISTS**: Read data-model.md for entities and relationships\n   - **IF EXISTS**: Read contracts/ for API specifications and test requirements\n   - **IF EXISTS**: Read research.md for technical decisions and constraints\n   - **IF EXISTS**: Read quickstart.md for integration scenarios\n\n4. **Project Setup Verification**:\n   - **REQUIRED**: Create/verify ignore files based on actual project setup:\n\n   **Detection & Creation Logic**:\n   - Check if the following command succeeds to determine if the repository is a git repo (create/verify .gitignore if so):\n\n     ```sh\n     git rev-parse --git-dir 2>/dev/null\n     ```\n\n   - Check if Dockerfile* exists or Docker in plan.md → create/verify .dockerignore\n   - Check if .eslintrc* exists → create/verify .eslintignore\n   - Check if eslint.config.* exists → ensure the config's `ignores` entries cover required patterns\n   - Check if .prettierrc* exists → create/verify .prettierignore\n   - Check if .npmrc or package.json exists → create/verify .npmignore (if publishing)\n   - Check if terraform files (*.tf) exist → create/verify .terraformignore\n   - Check if .helmignore needed (helm charts present) → create/verify .helmignore\n\n   **If ignore file already exists**: Verify it contains essential patterns, append missing critical patterns only\n   **If ignore file missing**: Create with full pattern set for detected technology\n\n   **Common Patterns by Technology** (from plan.md tech stack):\n   - **Node.js/JavaScript/TypeScript**: `node_modules/`, `dist/`, `build/`, `*.log`, `.env*`\n   - **Python**: `__pycache__/`, `*.pyc`, `.venv/`, `venv/`, `dist/`, `*.egg-info/`\n   - **Java**: `target/`, `*.class`, `*.jar`, `.gradle/`, `build/`\n   - **C#/.NET**: `bin/`, `obj/`, `*.user`, `*.suo`, `packages/`\n   - **Go**: `*.exe`, `*.test`, `vendor/`, `*.out`\n   - **Ruby**: `.bundle/`, `log/`, `tmp/`, `*.gem`, `vendor/bundle/`\n   - **PHP**: `vendor/`, `*.log`, `*.cache`, `*.env`\n   - **Rust**: `target/`, `debug/`, `release/`, `*.rs.bk`, `*.rlib`, `*.prof*`, `.idea/`, `*.log`, `.env*`\n   - **Kotlin**: `build/`, `out/`, `.gradle/`, `.idea/`, `*.class`, `*.jar`, `*.iml`, `*.log`, `.env*`\n   - **C++**: `build/`, `bin/`, `obj/`, `out/`, `*.o`, `*.so`, `*.a`, `*.exe`, `*.dll`, `.idea/`, `*.log`, `.env*`\n   - **C**: `build/`, `bin/`, `obj/`, `out/`, `*.o`, `*.a`, `*.so`, `*.exe`, `Makefile`, `config.log`, `.idea/`, `*.log`, `.env*`\n   - **Swift**: `.build/`, `DerivedData/`, `*.swiftpm/`, `Packages/`\n   - **R**: `.Rproj.user/`, `.Rhistory`, `.RData`, `.Ruserdata`, `*.Rproj`, `packrat/`, `renv/`\n   - **Universal**: `.DS_Store`, `Thumbs.db`, `*.tmp`, `*.swp`, `.vscode/`, `.idea/`\n\n   **Tool-Specific Patterns**:\n   - **Docker**: `node_modules/`, `.git/`, `Dockerfile*`, `.dockerignore`, `*.log*`, `.env*`, `coverage/`\n   - **ESLint**: `node_modules/`, `dist/`, `build/`, `coverage/`, `*.min.js`\n   - **Prettier**: `node_modules/`, `dist/`, `build/`, `coverage/`, `package-lock.json`, `yarn.lock`, `pnpm-lock.yaml`\n   - **Terraform**: `.terraform/`, `*.tfstate*`, `*.tfvars`, `.terraform.lock.hcl`\n   - **Kubernetes/k8s**: `*.secret.yaml`, `secrets/`, `.kube/`, `kubeconfig*`, `*.key`, `*.crt`\n\n5. Parse tasks.md structure and extract:\n   - **Task phases**: Setup, Tests, Core, Integration, Polish\n   - **Task dependencies**: Sequential vs parallel execution rules\n   - **Task details**: ID, description, file paths, parallel markers [P]\n   - **Execution flow**: Order and dependency requirements\n\n6. Execute implementation following the task plan:\n   - **Phase-by-phase execution**: Complete each phase before moving to the next\n   - **Respect dependencies**: Run sequential tasks in order, parallel tasks [P] can run together  \n   - **Follow TDD approach**: Execute test tasks before their corresponding implementation tasks\n   - **File-based coordination**: Tasks affecting the same files must run sequentially\n   - **Validation checkpoints**: Verify each phase completion before proceeding\n\n7. Implementation execution rules:\n   - **Setup first**: Initialize project structure, dependencies, configuration\n   - **Tests before code**: If you need to write tests for contracts, entities, and integration scenarios\n   - **Core development**: Implement models, services, CLI commands, endpoints\n   - **Integration work**: Database connections, middleware, logging, external services\n   - **Polish and validation**: Unit tests, performance optimization, documentation\n\n8. Progress tracking and error handling:\n   - Report progress after each completed task\n   - Halt execution if any non-parallel task fails\n   - For parallel tasks [P], continue with successful tasks, report failed ones\n   - Provide clear error messages with context for debugging\n   - Suggest next steps if implementation cannot proceed\n   - **IMPORTANT** For completed tasks, make sure to mark the task off as [X] in the tasks file.\n\n9. Completion validation:\n   - Verify all required tasks are completed\n   - Check that implemented features match the original specification\n   - Validate that tests pass and coverage meets requirements\n   - Confirm the implementation follows the technical plan\n   - Report final status with summary of completed work\n\nNote: This command assumes a complete task breakdown exists in tasks.md. If tasks are incomplete or missing, suggest running `/speckit.tasks` first to regenerate the task list.\n"}]}}

Load and analyze the implementation context:\n   - **REQUIRED**: Read tasks.md for the complete task list and execution plan\n   - **REQUIRED**: Read plan.md for tech stack, architecture, and file structure\n   - **IF EXISTS**: Read data-model.md for entities and relationships\n   - **IF EXISTS**: Read contracts/ for API specifications and test requirements\n   - **IF EXISTS**: Read research.md for technical decisions and constraints\n   - **IF EXISTS**: Read quickstart.md for integration scenarios\n\n4. **Project Setup Verification**:\n   - **REQUIRED**: Create/verify ignore files based on actual project setup:\n\n   **Detection & Creation Logic**:\n   - Check if the following command succeeds to determine if the repository is a git repo (create/verify .gitignore if so):\n\n     ```sh\n     git rev-parse --git-dir 2>/dev/null\n     ```\n\n   - Check if Dockerfile* exists or Docker in plan.md → create/verify .dockerignore\n   - Check if .eslintrc* exists → create/verify .eslintignore\n   - Check if eslint.config.* exists → ensure the config's `ignores` entries cover required patterns\n   - Check if .prettierrc* exists → create/verify .prettierignore\n   - Check if .npmrc or package.json exists → create/verify .npmignore (if publishing)\n   - Check if terraform files (*.tf) exist → create/verify .terraformignore\n   - Check if .helmignore needed (helm charts present) → create/verify .helmignore\n\n   **If ignore file already exists**: Verify it contains essential patterns, append missing critical patterns only\n   **If ignore file missing**: Create with full pattern set for detected technology\n\n   **Common Patterns by Technology** (from plan.md tech stack):\n   - **Node.js/JavaScript/TypeScript**: `node_modules/`, `dist/`, `build/`, `*.log`, `.env*`\n   - **Python**: `__pycache__/`, `*.pyc`, `.venv/`, `venv/`, `dist/`, `*.egg-info/`\n   - **Java**: `target/`, `*.class`, `*.jar`, `.gradle/`, `build/`\n   - **C#/.NET**: `bin/`, `obj/`, `*.user`, `*.suo`, `packages/`\n   - **Go**: `*.exe`, `*.test`, `vendor/`, `*.out`\n   - **Ruby**: `.bundle/`, `log/`, `tmp/`, `*.gem`, `vendor/bundle/`\n   - **PHP**: `vendor/`, `*.log`, `*.cache`, `*.env`\n   - **Rust**: `target/`, `debug/`, `release/`, `*.rs.bk`, `*.rlib`, `*.prof*`, `.idea/`, `*.log`, `.env*`\n   - **Kotlin**: `build/`, `out/`, `.gradle/`, `.idea/`, `*.class`, `*.jar`, `*.iml`, `*.log`, `.env*`\n   - **C++**: `build/`, `bin/`, `obj/`, `out/`, `*.o`, `*.so`, `*.a`, `*.exe`, `*.dll`, `.idea/`, `*.log`, `.env*`\n   - **C**: `build/`, `bin/`, `obj/`, `out/`, `*.o`, `*.a`, `*.so`, `*.exe`, `Makefile`, `config.log`, `.idea/`, `*.log`, `.env*`\n   - **Swift**: `.build/`, `DerivedData/`, `*.swiftpm/`, `Packages/`\n   - **R**: `.Rproj.user/`, `.Rhistory`, `.RData`, `.Ruserdata`, `*.Rproj`, `packrat/`, `renv/`\n   - **Universal**: `.DS_Store`, `Thumbs.db`, `*.tmp`, `*.swp`, `.vscode/`, `.idea/`\n\n   **Tool-Specific Patterns**:\n   - **Docker**: `node_modules/`, `.git/`, `Dockerfile*`, `.dockerignore`, `*.log*`, `.env*`, `coverage/`\n   - **ESLint**: `node_modules/`, `dist/`, `build/`, `coverage/`, `*.min.js`\n   - **Prettier**: `node_modules/`, `dist/`, `build/`, `coverage/`, `package-lock.json`, `yarn.lock`, `pnpm-lock.yaml`\n   - **Terraform**: `.terraform/`, `*.tfstate*`, `*.tfvars`, `.terraform.lock.hcl`\n   - **Kubernetes/k8s**: `*.secret.yaml`, `secrets/`, `.kube/`, `kubeconfig*`, `*.key`, `*.crt`\n\n5. Parse tasks.md structure and extract:\n   - **Task phases**: Setup, Tests, Core, Integration, Polish\n   - **Task dependencies**: Sequential vs parallel execution rules\n   - **Task details**: ID, description, file paths, parallel markers [P]\n   - **Execution flow**: Order and dependency requirements\n\n6. Execute implementation following the task plan:\n   - **Phase-by-phase execution**: Complete each phase before moving to the next\n   - **Respect dependencies**: Run sequential tasks in order, parallel tasks [P] can run together  \n   - **Follow TDD approach**: Execute test tasks before their corresponding implementation tasks\n   - **File-based coordination**: Tasks affecting the same files must run sequentially\n   - **Validation checkpoints**: Verify each phase completion before proceeding\n\n7. Implementation execution rules:\n   - **Setup first**: Initialize project structure, dependencies, configuration\n   - **Tests before code**: If you need to write tests for contracts, entities, and integration scenarios\n   - **Core development**: Implement models, services, CLI commands, endpoints\n   - **Integration work**: Database connections, middleware, logging, external services\n   - **Polish and validation**: Unit tests, performance optimization, documentation\n\n8. Progress tracking and error handling:\n   - Report progress after each completed task\n   - Halt execution if any non-parallel task fails\n   - For parallel tasks [P], continue with successful tasks, report failed ones\n   - Provide clear error messages with context for debugging\n   - Suggest next steps if implementation cannot proceed\n   - **IMPORTANT** For completed tasks, make sure to mark the task off as [X] in the tasks file.\n\n9. Completion validation:\n   - Verify all required tasks are completed\n   - Check that implemented features match the original specification\n   - Validate that tests pass and coverage meets requirements\n   - Confirm the implementation follows the technical plan\n   - Report final status with summary of completed work\n\nNote: This command assumes a complete task breakdown exists in tasks.md. If tasks are incomplete or missing, suggest running `/speckit.tasks` first to regenerate the task list.\n","images":[]}}

This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: C:/Users/ginol/Desktop/projects/sistema-kardex/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path.

(file: C:/Users/ginol/Desktop/projects/sistema-kardex/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: C:/Users/ginol/Desktop/projects/sistema-kardex/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: C:/Users/ginol/Desktop/projects/sistema-kardex/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: C:/Users/ginol/Desktop/projects/sistema-kardex/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: C:/Users/ginol/Desktop/projects/sistema-kardex/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: C:/Users/ginol/Desktop/projects/sistema-kardex/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: C:/Users/ginol/Desktop/projects/sistema-kardex/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}
